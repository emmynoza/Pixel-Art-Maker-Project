# Pixel-Art-Maker-Project

Make a custom grid and add color to each cell on each click. This is part of Udacity's Intro to Programming Course

## How it works:

1) Input the height or the number of rows
2) Input the Width or the number of columns
3) Click `submit` to make grid
4) Select the color to fill the desired cell

## Future Updates
* Be able to fill the cells while holding down the mouse
